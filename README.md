BEP Editor for Dragon Engine Yakuza Games

A work-in-progress BEP editor for Dragon Engine Yakuza games. Currently only supports conversion between DE and DE 2.0 games. A more in-depth explanation will be written at a later point.

Massive thanks to Miko for basically adding all of the property types for conversion in between DE and DE 2.0 and for testing and providing feedback for the program.
